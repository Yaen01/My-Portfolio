      <p id="aboutP-P">Hey there! my name is Yaen. The purpose of this page is to tell you more about my past, present,
        and goals that I have in the future. You can think of this as a mini self-biography.</p>



      <h3 id="about-paragraph-section">Childhood</h3>
      <p id="aboutP">I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the year 2001. I was a pretty different kid than others
        my age at the time. According to my Kinder Garden teacher, while she taught the other kids I did not want to
        do what they were doing so I would just ask her for some blocks and go under a table and build things. I was
        able to pass school until I attended 3rd grade. The school believed that I was mentally challenged and had to
        be moved back a grade, but after this my mother appointed me to a phychologist and I was not diagnosed with
        any mental problems and I also had to take an IQ test which showed that my IQ was a lot higher than the
        average kid at that age. Because of this my mother decided to homeschool me so I could keep learning in my
        own way and not go back a grade. During my time homeschooled I was able to learn a lot of things that a
        traditional school would not offer. I was able to do all the research I wanted to do on NASA, and Space
        related things. Which allowed me to get into a summer camp that was sponsored by NASA. After this I met some
        people at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico where they had a program called Techno Inventors, where
        young students could expand their knowledge in many technological areas such as Engineering, Programming, and
        Game Design. There were state-wide tournaments where we competed in these areas, in which I was able to get
        first
        place in the development of applications, and get best team work award. Because of my interest in Engineering
        and NASA, my dream as a kid was to be an Aerospace Engineer. Not only did homeschool allow me to learn more
        about science but it also allowed to develop a good English vocabulary. I was able to study English in
        Rosseta Stone, and also practice all of the words I would learn by playing video games such as Minecraft and
        communicating in English. I was homeschooled all the way until High School, my mom believed that it would be
        better if I learned in a traditional environent so I could be better prepared for college.</p>



      <h3 id="about-paragraph-section">Present / High School</h3>
      <p id="aboutP">Since my mother believed that going to a traditional High School would help me develop skills
        that would be required in college, such as hard deadlines, working with others, and not being the only student. She
        decided that we would move to Providence, Rhode Island. She believed that because of the great colleges around
        the area, and because of the amount of educational opportunities that are offered in the U.S compared to Puerto
        Rico. I was enrolled in 360 High School, it was a brand new school that was designed very
        differently from a traditional high school. During my Freshman year I joined the Blue Wave Robotics Team which
        was also new and ended up as the Team Captain. I had a lot of fun creating a robot with my peers, and going on
        tournaments to see how our robot would compete against other robots. I was also ellected as a Co-President,
        which allowed me to improve upon my public speaking and problem solving skills. </p>
